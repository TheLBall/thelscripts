# TheLScripts


This is where I will be putting scripts for you all to enjoy. The windows branch is for Windows Batch Scripts. The linux branch is where all the scripts for Arch linux will be stored as well as the prerequestite lists.
The Arch Linux scripts will be made executable ahead of time so you don't have to do chmod +x foo.sh.
